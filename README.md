#### Folders view
Thumbstick: 
- left/right for switching pages

## Requirements

- Linux server with installed and configured web server including https (WebXR requires https)
- Python 3 installed
- FFMPEG installed (required if thumbnails generator will be used)

## Setup

### Using JSON solution and provided Python scripts

- Edit `config.ini` providing correct paths

    `videos_location` => absolute path to folder containing videos folder and thumbnails folder (eg. for  `/media/videos` set this to `videos_location=/media/videos`)
  
    `videos_folder` => main folder where videos are located (eg. for /media/videos/vr set this to `videos_folder=vr`)
  
    `thumbnails_folder` => main folder where Thumbnails are located (eg. for /media/videos/thumbnails set this to `thumbnails_folder=thumbnails`)
  
    `videos_relative_path` => this is relative path from player folder to videos folder, must be inside www folder (eg. player is in `/var/www/html/web_vr_player` your videos are available via symlink from `/var/www/html/videos` then set this to `videos_relative_path=../videos`)
  
    To create symlink => 
        
        cd /var/www/html/
        ln /media/videos videos

- Make `init.sh` file executable `chmod u+x init.sh` and run it. This script downloads ini parser for bash
- If you don't have Thumbnails generated for your videos and want to use them run `generate_thumbnails.sh` script
- Finally run `generate_files_json.sh` script to generate `files.json` containing list of VR files for player

Script can set screen type based on file name. Add one of following at the end of file name: `_TB` (Top-Bottom), `_SCREEN`. Default screen type is Side-by-Side.

Supported tags:

`_SCREEN` - normal 2D screen

`_SBS` - Side by Side

`_TB` - Top Bottom 180

`_360` - Top Bottom 360

`_2D_180` - fisheye 180, not VR (one lens)

`_2D_360` - fisheye 360, not VR (one lens)

## Generating your own JSON file with video sources

```
<span id="json_file" hidden>files.json</span>
```

## Troubleshooting

If videos or player can't be loaded make sure that this app files are owned by web server user (eg. www-data) and that web server user can read video and thumbnail files (eg. www-data is owner or permissions for others include read).
